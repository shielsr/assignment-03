As a .... I want to ... so that I ....
1. As a promoter, I want to post upcoming gigs with details on artist, time, date, and venue, so fans will know what gigs are coming up.
2. As a promoter, I want to create a ticket sale event with start date, start time, amount of tickets, so I can sell tickets and make money.
3. As a promoter, I don't want to sell tickets before the sale start date, so fans can be ready to buy at a specific time.
4. As a promoter, I want the sale to stop when tickets run out, so I don't sell too many tickets.
5. - As a promoter, I want to know who has bought how many tickets, so I can send the correct amount of tickets to the right person.
[OUT OF SCOPE] As a promoter, I want to be able to toggle 'dynamic pricing', so the price of tickets will increase when quantities run low.

Customer:
1. As a customer, I want to see when the ticket sale begins so I can be ready at a specific date and time.
2. As a customer, I want to buy tickets so I can attend gigs.
3. As a customer, I want to see the final ticket price, so I know how much I will be paying
4. As a customer, I want to search for artists I like, to see when and where their next gigs are.
