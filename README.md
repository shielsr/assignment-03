Assignment 3 - Python module

# Process

- Brainstorming initial ideas for assignment
- Writing user stories and entities
- Create models.py file with some basic classes
- Created sandbox.ipynb to start experimenting with my classes
- Fleshed out the Promoter, Gig and Sale classes
- Wrote functions to switch the sale on at a certain date and off when tickets run out
- Wrote fucntions for the buyer, and for counting how many tickets are left
- Created a list to store who buys tickets and the amount of tickets
- Set up Flask. Created the app.py file and template html files.
- Got the placeholder 'gig' working, along with the ability to 'purchase' tickets
- Added basic login session functionality
- Allowed users to add new gigs, with loop on homepage showing newly added gigs.
- Every new gig & sale event has its own /buy page, with the event ID added to the URL
- To demonstrate understanding of Javascript, I added a carousel to the mobile homepage, with code from https://medium.com/@pietrogon/how-to-create-a-carousel-with-html-css-and-javascript-step-by-step-guide-f46c267692d2
- Included a Bootstrap navbar for desktop and mobile menus. Followed the documentation here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
- Again to demonstrate understanding of Javascript, I worked with Rob Cleary (???????) to fetch the 'tickets_left' amount and update that on the /buy page when the user clicks the 'Refresh tickets' button. 
- Added logic to the homepage's 'Add a new gig' card so that the user must first log in before they can add a gig.
- Developed the login section further, adding a dict with promoter details, which can be edited on a 'My account' page (I followed Yoni's lesson here)
- Used Javascript to do error checking on form inputs for both the /buy and /add pages
- Used flex and grid in CSS to finalise the layout
- Added favicon and logo (generated by AI)
